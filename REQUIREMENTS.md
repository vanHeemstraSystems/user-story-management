# Requirements

- Package.json<br/>
  Change the name of the package as follows:

   "name": "replace-with-your-repository-name",<br/>
   "author": "Replace with your GitHub username",

- Hatch: simply run ```$ pip install hatch```.<br/>
  Your output will look something like this:
  ```...
     Installing collected packages: trove-classifiers, zstandard, uv, tomli-w, shellingham, pluggy, pathspec, hyperlink, click, userpath, hatchling, hatch
     Successfully installed click-8.1.7 hatch-1.13.0 hatchling-1.25.0 hyperlink-21.0.0 pathspec-0.12.1 pluggy-1.5.0 shellingham-1.5.4 tomli-w-1.1.0 trove-classifiers-2024.10.21.16 userpath-1.9.2 uv-0.4.26 zstandard-0.23.0
   ```

You can also install Hatch as an application on [Windows and Mac](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/#installers) operating systems. [Conda](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/#conda), [pipx](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/#pipx), [Homebrew](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/#homebrew), [MacPorts](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/#macports), [Fedora](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/#fedora), and [Void Linux](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/#void-linux) installation methods are also available.

We'll **not** add ```hatch``` to the ```requirements.txt``` file, as it is used purely to manage the development and build of the application but is not part of the application.

- Docker Desktop: to make use of [OpenHands](https://appall-hand.dev) on Mac, the Docker Desktop for Mac needs to be installed on the Mac you are running OpenHands on in the browser.
