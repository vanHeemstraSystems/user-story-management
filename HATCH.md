## Creating a Project

When you create any Python application, you have to create a folder structure for your application logic, tests, documentation, and other project-specific files like ```pyproject.toml```. As a project manager, Hatch lets you initialize a Python application that contains all the project setup files and folders. You just need to make changes to these files to fit your application.

To create a new project, all you have to do is run the ```hatch new <project name>``` command. This command creates a project directory containing a source code directory (```src```), a test directory (```tests```), and a configuration file for project-related tools (```pyproject.toml```).

For this tutorial, let’s create a simple Python application named hatch-project that uses a Flask API. To do so, **FROM THE ROOT OF THE REPOSITORY** run ```$ hatch new "Hatch Project"```. The folder structure that’s created will look like this:

```
$ hatch new "Hatch Project"
hatch-project
|---- src
|     |---- hatch_project
|           |---- __about__.py
|           |---- __init__.py
|---- tests
|     |---- __init__.py
|---- LICENSE.txt
|---- README.md
|---- pyproject.toml
```

> **Note**: If you want to initialize an existing project, you can do so using the ```hatch new --init``` command. If there is a ```setup.py``` file available in your project, a ```setuptools``` file will be generated from it. Otherwise, Hatch interactively guides you to produce the content for the configuration file.

We list the content for most of these files next.

Once you’ve created your Python application, open the ```pyproject.toml``` file. You should see that a lot of your project configuration values, such as dependencies and the Python version, are prefilled by Hatch. You’ll also notice other sections with the pattern ```[tool.hatch.*]```, which is where you’ll configure your project to use different Python dependencies, environments, and Python versions.
