# 200 - Web Interface

Launch a modern, responsive web interface for visual task management:

## Start the web server (opens browser automatically)

```
backlog browser
```

## Custom port

```
backlog browser --port 8080
```

## Don't open browser automatically

```
backlog browser --no-open
```

The web interface provides:

- Interactive Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality
- Task creation and editing with rich forms and validation
- Real-time updates as you manage tasks
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Archive tasks with confirmation dialogs
- Seamless CLI integration - changes sync with your markdown files
