# 300 - Building Our Application

Based on [Building React Apps in an Nx Monorepo](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial).

In this tutorial you'll learn how to use React with Nx in a monorepo setup.

What will you learn?

- how to create a new React application
- how to run a single task (i.e. serve your app) or run multiple tasks in parallel
- how to leverage code generators to scaffold components
- how to modularize your codebase and impose architectural constraints for better maintainability
- [how to speed up CI with Nx Cloud âš¡](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial#fast-ci)

**Note**:  this tutorial sets up a repo with applications and libraries in their own subfolders. If you are looking for a React standalone app setup then check out our [React standalone app tutorial](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-standalone-tutorial).
